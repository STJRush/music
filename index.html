  <h1>Music in St.Joseph's Secondary School</h1>
  <p>St.Joseph's has a wonderful music department. There are many very talented and musical students. <br>We have a school choir that puts on many shows, especially around Christmas time where they take part in many carol services. The choir is fun and welcoming and can give students musical oppurtunities such as solos and school functions and county-wide choir gatherings like the Emmanuel concert.  </p>
