 <h1>Music in St.Joseph's Secondary School</h1>
  
  <p>St.Joseph's has a wonderful music department. There are many very talented and musical students. <br>We have a school choir that puts on many shows, especially around Christmas time where they take part in many carol services. The choir is fun and welcoming and can give students musical opportunities such as solos and school functions and county-wide choir gatherings like the Emmanuel concert.  </p>

   <h2 id="Music Course">Music Course</h2>
   <p>St. Joseph’s offers fun and informative music classes. Our music teachers are school-renowned for being interesting and down to earth. The Junior Cert music course includes practical work, the study of set songs and choice songs, listening tests, a general study and compositions. That may sound like a lot, but our great teachers make sure that students know all of the material and get top results.

  <h2 id="Music Events">Music Events</h2>
   <p>The school choir takes part in many music events throughout the year, especially around Christmas time. They put on a carol service for the school, an evening carol service for parents and teachers, and take part in the community carol service. They also sing in Dublin airport, shopping centres and companies. There’s also the Emmanuel concert, which they take part in every year in the Helix and our school always has many soloists.
